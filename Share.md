PBL-Curriculum:
    The PBL Portal was designed for our college to make the process done in te college more transparent to the parents, staffs and students.We have used the concept of ASP.NET to design the webpage which is implemented in the tool Visual Studio. There will be man buttons, each consists of a folder were the admin can upload different materials and the user can only be viewed. The user cannot modify the data inside the folder. Only admin have the rights to modify the folder. MYSQL is used for the database processes. An student, staffs, parents can be viewed the information avilable in the folders.
